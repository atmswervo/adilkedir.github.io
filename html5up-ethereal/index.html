									<h2 class="major">Work Experince</h2>
									<p>Over the years I've worked at Amazon, Nordstrom, and Ikea and gathered important skills when it comes to customer interaction as well as business operations. I learned the logistics of the warehouse while at Amazon. Understanding how important it is to pay attention to details or else it may affect the process down the line. At Ikea, I also gain more warehouse experience as well as customer service skills. Understanding how to speak to a customer and help when they need it. Learning the layout of the store and answering other common questions a customer may have. While working at Nordstrom I had a call center role. Having customer call and explain the issues their facing. It can range from a billing issue they received, a package that their expected has never been received, and even damaged goods or refunds. Working at all these places helped me to work at a fast pace and accurately at the same time.</p>
